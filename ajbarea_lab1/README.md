# Module 1: Mobile Robot Kinematics

## Overview

This module explores fundamental concepts of mobile robot kinematics using the e-puck robot in Webots simulation. You'll implement and test straight-line motion control and circular trajectory following using differential drive kinematics.

## Module Structure

### Task 1: Straight-Line Motion Control (`lab1_task1.py`)

**Objective**: Move the robot in a straight line for a specified distance at a given velocity

**Key Concepts**:

- Velocity control using wheel motors
- Position feedback from wheel encoders  
- Distance measurement and tracking

**Parameters**:

- `X`: Target distance in inches
- `V`: Linear velocity in inches/second (range: -6.28 to 6.28)

### Task 2: Circular Motion Control (`lab1_task2.py`)

**Objective**: Execute circular trajectories using differential drive kinematics

**Key Concepts**:

- Differential wheel speed calculation
- Angular velocity relationships: `W = V / R`
- Kinematic equations for curved motion

**Parameters**:

- `R1`: Circle radius in inches (0 = turn in place)
- `V`: Linear velocity in inches/second

## Robot Specifications

- **Wheel Radius**: 0.8 inches
- **Wheelbase**: 2.28 inches (distance between wheels)
- **Max Velocity**: 6.28 rad/s per wheel

## World File

The simulation uses `lab1.wbt` which includes:

- e-puck robot with wheel encoders
- Distance sensors (front, left, right) - configured for Webots R2025a
- Basic rectangular arena environment

## Running the Module

1. Open Webots R2025a
2. Load `webots/worlds/lab1.wbt`
3. The simulation starts with Task 1 controller by default
4. To switch to Task 2:
   - Stop simulation
   - Change controller in robot properties from "lab1_task1" to "lab1_task2"
   - Restart simulation

## Experiment Guidelines

1. **Modify parameters** in the designated sections of each controller
2. **Test different velocities** within the motor limits (-6.28 to 6.28)
3. **Observe encoder feedback** and actual vs. expected performance
4. **Document results** comparing theoretical and measured values

## Key Learning Outcomes

- Understanding of encoder-based position feedback
- Implementation of velocity control for mobile robots
- Application of differential drive kinematics
- Analysis of motion accuracy and error sources
- Real-world calibration and empirical corrections

## Theory vs. Reality: Why Empirical Factors Matter

While theoretical kinematics provide the foundation for robot motion control, real-world implementations require **empirical corrections** due to several physical factors:

### Physical Limitations

- **Wheel Slippage**: Wheels don't grip perfectly, especially during turns
- **Mechanical Play**: Gear backlash and mounting tolerances affect precision
- **Manufacturing Variations**: Actual wheel radius and wheelbase differ slightly from specifications

### Sensor & Control Issues

- **Encoder Quantization**: Discrete encoder ticks vs. continuous motion
- **Control Loop Dynamics**: Acceleration/deceleration effects during start/stop
- **Timing Precision**: Simulation timestep discretization

### Mathematical Approximations

- **Distance Measurement**: Using one wheel to estimate robot center motion
- **Circular Motion**: Assuming perfect differential drive kinematics
- **Coordinate Frames**: Differences between theoretical and actual robot geometry

### Implementation

In **Task 2 (Circular Motion)**, we use an **empirical scaling factor** (~1.22) to correct the theoretical travel distance:

```python
# Theoretical: Left wheel travels 2π(R + wheelbase/2)
theoretical_distance = 2 * math.pi * (R + WHEEL_BASE/2)

# Reality: Need extra distance due to physical factors
empirical_factor = 1.25  # Determined through testing (R=6,15)
actual_distance_needed = theoretical_distance * empirical_factor
```

This demonstrates the **essential engineering principle**: **theory guides design, but empirical testing ensures performance**.

## Experimental Results Summary

### Task 1: Straight-Line Motion Performance

- **Accuracy**: High precision for distances > 6 inches
- **Velocity Control**: Consistent performance across velocity range
- **Encoder Feedback**: Reliable distance measurement using wheel encoders
- **Key Finding**: Motion accuracy improves with longer distances due to reduced impact of acceleration/deceleration phases

### Task 2: Circular Motion Performance  

- **Circle Completion**: Excellent trajectory following with empirical factor (1.25)
- **Differential Drive**: Successful implementation of kinematic equations
- **Turn-in-Place**: Precise rotation using opposite wheel velocities
- **Key Finding**: Real-world physics require calibration factors beyond theoretical calculations

### Implementation Highlights

- **Robust Input Validation**: Parameter checking with helpful warnings
- **Velocity Clamping**: Automatic scaling to stay within motor limits
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time feedback during motion execution
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of edge cases and invalid inputs
